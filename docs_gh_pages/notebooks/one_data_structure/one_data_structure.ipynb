    "### Session Folder\n",
    "Each experiment has a unique session folder which has the following pattern,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lab_name/Subjects/subject_name/date/session_number\n",
    "e.g\n",
    "cortexlab/Subjects/KS023/2020-03-04/001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections\n",
    "Within a session folder, files are organised into a number of sub-folders, called collections. These are used to group identical datasets by device or preprocessing sofware. For example spikes collected on two different probes are grouped into the collections,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alf/probe00\n",
    "alf/probe01\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revisions\n",
    "Revisions are used when one or more versions of the same dataset, with slighlty different preprocessing, exist. Revision folders are denoted by a date surrounded by a pound sign. In the example file strucutre shown above, the dataset spikes.times.npy has two versions,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alf/probe01/spikes.times.npy\n",
    "alf/probe01/#2021-07-05#/spikes.times.npy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filenames\n",
    "The file names contain at least two components; an object and an attribute, separated by a period. For example a file called trials.intervals represents the trials object with an intervals attribute, while a file called probes.description has the probes objects with the description attribute. All attributes belonging to the same object are identical size. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespaces\n",
    "You will notice that some of the filenames begin with an underscore, for example _ibl_trials.intervals.npy. The pattern `_ibl_` is referred to as a namespace and is used for datasets that are not intended to be standard in the community, but are specific to the IBL. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Experiment IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment Ids - link to the tutorial\n",
    "UUID and session path are the two most common ways of representing eids within the IBL, however, ONE also supports other types of , please see this tutorial for more details and conversion tricks\n",

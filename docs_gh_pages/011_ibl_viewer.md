# IBL Viewer

The IBL Viewer is a simple and fast interactive visualization tool based on VTK that uses GPU accelerated volume and 
surface rendering. It runs on python 3.8+ and it can be embed in Jupyter Lab/Notebook and Qt user interfaces.

At the International Brain Laboratory, this tool is used by scientists for data/models analysis. 
From electrophysiological data to neuronal connectivity, this tool allows simple and effective 3D visualization for 
many use-cases like multi-slicing and time series (even on volumes).

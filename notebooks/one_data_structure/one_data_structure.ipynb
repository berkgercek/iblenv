    "\n",
    "# Data organisation\n",
    "IBL data is structured using the ALyx File (ALF) name specification. For more details about ALF see this [section](../../04_alf.html).\n",
    "Here we describe some key ALF concepts in the context of the IBL data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following file structure shows a subset of the datasets used in IBL. For a full description of all datasets please\n",
    "see this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OqIqqakPakHXRAwceYLwFY9gOrm8_P62XIfCTnHwstg/edit)\n",

    "### Session Folder\n",
    "Each experiment has a unique session folder which has the following pattern,\n",
    "```\n",
    "lab/Subjects/subject/date/session_number\n",
    "e.g cortexlab/Subjects/KS023/2020-03-04/001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections\n",
    "Within a session folder, files are organised into a number of sub-folders, called collections. These are used to group identical datasets by device or preprocessing sofware. For example spikes collected on two different probes are grouped into the collections,\n",
    "```\n",
    "alf/probe00\n",
    "alf/probe01\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revisions\n",
    "Revisions are used when one or more versions of the same dataset, with slighlty different preprocessing, exist. Revision folders are denoted by a date surrounded by a pound sign. In the example file strucutre shown above, the dataset spikes.times.npy has two versions,\n",
    "```\n",
    "alf/probe01/spikes.times.npy\n",
    "alf/probe01/#2021-07-05#/spikes.times.npy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filenames\n",
    "The file names contain at least two components; an object and an attribute, separated by a period. For example a file called trials.intervals represents the trials object with an intervals attribute, while a file called probes.description has the probes objects with the description attribute. All attributes belonging to the same object are identical size. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespaces\n",
    "You will notice that some of the filenames begin with an underscore, for example _ibl_trials.intervals.npy. The pattern `_ibl_` is referred to as a namespace and is used for datasets that are not intended to be standard in the community, but are specific to the IBL. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Experiment IDs\n",
    "Each experimental session is identified by a unique identifier known as an experiment ID (eid). The most common way of\n",
    "representing eids within the IBL are,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(str) : An experiment UUID as a string\n",
    "e.g  '\n",
    "(str) : A session string of the form <subject>/<date>/<number>\n",
    "e.g 'KS023/2019-12-10/001'\n",
    "(Path) : A pathlib ALF path of the form <lab>/Subjects/<subject>/<date>/<number>\n",
    "e.g Path(r'cortexlab/Subjects/KS023/2019-12-10/001')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ONE also supports a range of other experimental session representations. Please see this\n",
    "[tutorial](../../notebooks_external/docs_experiment_ids.html) for more details and for useful conversion tricks.\n",
